RDF is a framework for representing information in the Web.

RDF graphs are sets of subject-predicate-object triples, where the elements may be IRIs, blank nodes, or datatyped literals.

IRIs can be minted and provide a means of locating and retrieving information resources on a network (in which case they are not only identifiers but also locators).

Retrievable information resources are access controlled and authoritative over themselves.

Access is simple, there are only two kinds of actions one can perform over an information resource: query (read in its simplest form aka select/construct/ask/describe, implies copy aka cache and also version) and update (add to it aka insert, remove from it aka delete, or a combination of both).

Authority is complex as it highlights the gap between the real world and information.

Authoritative sources of truth organise behind protocols, processes, co-opting, cryptography and ultimately rely on trust and are as faillible as their weakest link.
